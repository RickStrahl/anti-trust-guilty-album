In the land of silicone dreams
Where gadgets reign supreme
Shiny toys bought for a thrill
Never enough to get your fill
Obsolete the day that you buy
Time to live it’s fixed to die

Forced on to the subscription ride
Prices are rising, I'm stuck in the tide
I wanna get out, they won't let me go
Trapped in this cycle of digital woe

Enshittify! Enshittify!
Your upgrades have been denied

Enshittify! Enshittify!
Rip it up, and watch it die

Enshittify! Enshittify!
Digitally crucified

Enshittify! Enshittify! 
Don’t you bother asking why
