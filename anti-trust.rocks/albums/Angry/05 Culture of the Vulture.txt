Prey on your mind,
Mining what they can find
Pumped full of propaganda
No room for minds to wander

Nickel and dimed
They’re robbing you blind
Tricked into ruinous debt
Trapped in a life of regret
 
   Left as a slave to the grind, 
   that leaves your life behind
   
   Lulled by convenience, 
   you’ve traded for obedience

      Hypnotized
      Financialized
      Compromised
      Demonized 

Culture of the Vulture
   Society’s sacrificed
Culture of the Vulture
   Minds are paralyzed
Culture of the Vulture
   Society's financialized
Culture of the Vulture
   Institutions compromised

A million eyes
Watch from the skies
Eyes on you all the time
Your thoughts are now crime

Another data breach
Identity under siege
Bribed for your vote
For sale without a quote

   Make your choice for red or blue, 
   and hope for something new

   You chose convenience, 
   and voted for obedience

      Hypnotized
      Financialized
      Compromised
      Demonized 

Culture of the Vulture
   Society’s sacrificed
Culture of the Vulture
   Minds are paralyzed
Culture of the Vulture
   Society's financialized
Culture of the Vulture
   Institutions compromised
