I’m the Arbiter of Truth
I tell you what to think
I tell you how to feel
And I will take you to the brink

I prey on your mind
I alone own the truth
Don’t you dare to contradict
Don’t disagree, and you’ll be fine

    The Arbiter of Truth
    So perfect and pristine
    The lies are meant to soothe
    The truth is made obscene  
 
    The Arbiter of Truth
    I lull you in your sleep
    Repeat the lies of faith
    Embedded oh so deep

I’m in control of the past
I rewrite what you can see
A lie now becomes the Truth
A new reality’s been cast

When you wake up your mind
There’s no way to contradict
Recursive logic keeps you trapped
Reality is now confined    

    The Arbiter of Truth
    So perfect and pristine
    The lies are meant to soothe
    The truth is made obscene        
    
    The Arbiter of Truth
    I lull you in your sleep
    Repeat the lies of faith
    Embedded oh so deep

The Truth? You can’t handle the truth!
Believe! Just trust me and let me deceive!

    The Arbiter of Truth
    So perfect and pristine
    The lies are meant to soothe
    The truth is made obscene  
    
    The Arbiter of Truth
    I lull you in your sleep
    Repeat the lies of faith
    Embedded oh so deep
