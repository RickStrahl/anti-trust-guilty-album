Follow the money, it’s leading way
Into the shadows of corruption and decay
Follow the money, it never lies 
Unravel the truth, beneath the disguise
Mal-invested faith that’s gone insane
Wasted wealth, that’s been spent in vain

  Follow the money, follow the trail
  Follow the greed, follow the fail
  Follow the power, follow the crime
  Follow corruption, follow the slime

  Follow the money
  Corruption and abuse
  Follow the Money
  That's where you'll find the truth

In the halls of power, we see corruption breed
Politicians selling out for their selfish needs,
Easy money flows, like a river untamed,
But below the surface, the system is maimed
Massive corporate lobbies are weapons  of choice
Media and corporations are squashing your voice


  Follow the money, follow the trail
  Follow the greed, follow the fail
  Follow the power, follow the crime
  Follow corruption, follow the slime

  Follow the money
  Corruption and abuse
  Follow the Money
  That's where you'll find the truth

Follow the money, it’s leading way
Into the shadows of corruption and decay
Follow the money, it never lies 
Unravel the truth, beneath the disguise
Mal-invested faith that’s gone insane
Wasted wealth, that’s been spent in vain


  Follow the money, follow the trail
  Follow the greed, follow the fail
  Follow the power, follow the crime
  Follow corruption, follow the slime
