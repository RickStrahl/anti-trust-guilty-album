So what – if the fucking world is ablaze
So what – I’ll walk through the fiery haze
So what – let the chaos fill the air
So what – I rise and I won’t despair
So what – I really don’t give a fuck

So what, so what, so what, so whaaat!

So what if the world is falling apart?
But I'll keep on dancing with a reckless heart
When the world finally goes up in smoke
I'll find my light, and that ain’t no joke

So what – living in a world of pain
So what – we can break the endless chain
So what – if the world is falling apart
So what – we laugh at it with all our heart
So what – just walk away and push your luck

So what, so what, so what, so whaaaat!
