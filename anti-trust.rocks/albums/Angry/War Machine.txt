For money, for honor
No one even knows 
What the hell we’re fighting for

Another proxy war   
Another worthless cause
Another wave of bloody gore

War is hell
Everybody knows
And yet here we are again 

Burn up the money
Burn up the air
Scream and shout about how it’s not fair

    The War Machine
      It’s a Wrecking Machine
    The War Machine
      It’s evil and mean
    The War Machine
      Never what is foreseen
    The War Machine
      It’s a Money Machine
    The Money Machine
      It’s a profit scheme
    The Money Machine
      It’s evil and mean   

Blow shit up
In the name of peace
War is the disease

All guts, no glory
Politician’s dreams
While a soldier screams

Send kids to war
It's a wartime racket
Works out great for the upper tax bracket

Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
There’s nothing and no one left to trust

    The War Machine
      It’s a Wrecking Machine
    The War Machine
      It’s evil and mean
    The War Machine
      Never what is foreseen
    The War Machine
      It’s a Money Machine
    The Money Machine
      It’s a profit scheme
    The Money Machine
      It’s evil and mean
