I’ve lost my mind, I’ve lost my place
In what pretends to be the last of this fucked up race 
Poked and prodded, from left and right
Provoked into just one more bloody fight

Fear and anger, and white lies
The master is calling without his disguise
Rich or poor, black and white
Heads or tails, we’ll lose this fight  

    I am just a rat in cage,
    Poked and prodded into a fucking rage
    I am just a rat in a rage,
    Primed and ready, trapped in a cage

The world is spinning, round and round 
I can’t keep up and I just keep losing ground
Trapped in the prison, of my mind
Afraid to look at what I might find

Climb the walls, scratch at the door 
There’s no escape, from bottom of the floor
The wheel keeps spinning, round and round
Let’s burn this fucker, down to the ground

    I am just a rat in cage,
    Poked and prodded into a fucking rage
    I am just a rat in a rage,
    Primed and ready, trapped in a cage
