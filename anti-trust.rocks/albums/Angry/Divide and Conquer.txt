You light a fuse and then you run away
Watching the wreckage from a million miles away

Throwing gasoline on a burning funeral pyre
With seething words that fight fire with fire

Fanning the flames of anger and hate
With empty proclamations denying a debate

Feeding the divisions, yeah thatâ€™s your only mission
Itching to troll the controlled opposition

    Dishonesty and lies
    In thinly veiled disguise
    Power hungry greed
    With nothing but conceit

    Divided by Anger
    Conquered by Fear


    Divide and Conquer 
        Sowing seeds of discontent
    Divide and Conquer
        With absolute indifference
    Divide and Conquer
        Malcontent is no accident
    
    Divide and Conquer!

Fingers that are pointing to assign endless blame,
With reasons that are nothing short of insane

Spewing ugly words of lofty condescension,
Locking down all minds in soulless detention

Burning all your bridges leaves nothing to defend
Only scorched Earth until the fucking end

Herded like rats into a corner of a cage,
Kill switch ready, primed and engaged

    Dishonesty and lies
    In thinly veiled disguise
    Power hungry greed
    With nothing but conceit
    
    Divided by Anger
    Conquered by Fear
  
    
    Divide and Conquer 
        Sowing seeds of discontent
    Divide and Conquer
        With absolute indifference
    Divide and Conquer
        Malcontent is no accident
    
    Divide and Conquer!
