Sailing down a sea of fate,
Up the creek on heaven’s gate,
Without a rudder, without a soul
Riding blind, it’s out of control

    Ghost Rider x4

The steering wheel is spinning wild,
Desperate measures for desperate times,
Sliding down into the final descent
The time has come, prepare to repent   

    Ghost Rider x4

Greasing the wheels with worthless deals
Promises to lies which cannot be denied
Arrogant diplomacy and partisan dichotomy
Burn it to the ground, the ship is going down

Soulless decisions and shameless lies  
Money grabbing deals, no longer in disguise
Feeding the rich, squeezing the poor  
Burn it to the ground, the ship is going down

    Ghost Rider - sailing blind in the night
    Ghost Rider - going down without a fight  

    (Lead Break)

    Ghost Rider - sailing blind in the night
    Ghost Rider - going down without a fight  

A war on drugs, a war on terror
The war machine feeds the endless horrors
Bombs and profits is a murderous game
The more that things change, the more they stay the same

Money grows on trees and debt is for free
Feeding on the trough of endless spending sprees
Future generations end up with the claims
The more that things change, the more they stay the same

    Ghost Rider x4

A tattered hand guides a sinking ship
Too weak to pry from its deadly grip
Heading for the rocks of disastrous shame
The ship is going down in eternal pain

    Ghost Rider x4
