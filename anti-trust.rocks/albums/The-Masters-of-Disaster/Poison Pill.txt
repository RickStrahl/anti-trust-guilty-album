Poisoning the well
Poisoning the soul
Poisoning the world 
for profit and control

Poisoning the money
Poisoning the land
Poisoning the mind
That’s always been the plan

    Take the poison pill and choose your side
    For better or for worse buckle up for the ride
    A toxic decision, a taste of bitter thrill
    C’mon just suck it down
    Just take the Poison Pill    
    Take the Poison Pill!   

Poisoned in your home
Poisoned by your food
Poisoned by your pills
We are all getting screwed

Poisoning your heart
Poisoning your air
Poisoning your wealth
It’s all so hard to square

    Take the poison pill and choose your side
    For better or for worse buckle up for the ride
    A toxic decision, a taste of bitter thrill
    C’mon just suck it down
    Just take the Poison Pill    
    Take the Poison Pill!

    Reject the Poison Pill!
    Reject the Poison Pill!
