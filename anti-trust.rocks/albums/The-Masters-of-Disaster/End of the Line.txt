In the neon city, where truth and dreams collide
At the end of the line, where hope has died
Concrete jungle rises, it's choking out the sky
Dancing on the embers, we’re wondering why

Progress marches on, in a tragic parade
Burning all our bridges that leave our debts unpaid
Politicians preaching about fairness and compassion
Choking down on freedom, that’s absolutely crushing

    The End of the Line
    We’re running out of time
    The earth’s veins are bleeding
    We’re in terminal decline
    The End of the Line, 
    There’s nothing left behind
    We’ve squandered our wealth
    How could we be so blind?

    The End of the Line
    We’re running out of time
    The earth’s veins are bleeding
    We’re in terminal decline
    The End of the Line, 
    There’s nothing left behind
    We’ve squandered our wealth
    How could we be so blind?
