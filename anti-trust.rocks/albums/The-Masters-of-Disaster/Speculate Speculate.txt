Markets go up, Markets go down
Nobody knows it’s all overblown

To the moon it goes, that’s what they say
Pushing speculation, each and every day

Play the Casino, the house always wins
Rigging the game, just for fucking grins

In for a penny, in for a pound,
Ready for a miss and that sucking sound?

	Speculate, Speculate 
	Now’s the time to tempt your fate

	Speculate, Speculate 
	Up and up at an endless rate
	
	Speculate, Speculate 
	Hoping the Fed inflates
	
	Speculate, Speculate 
	Did you really take the bait?

Growth über Alles, the corporate sprawl
Resource depletion, until we hit the wall

Socialized losses, privatized gains
Corporate greed, completely insane

Stratospheric highs, another record close 
How high it goes, nobody knows

Buying the dip, how can you miss?
Until the day it dies and takes a fucking piss

	No time to double down, ready to be drowned
	Beaten to the ground, shut it all down!
 
	Speculate, Speculate 
	Propping up the puppet state

	Speculate, Speculate 	
	Up and up at an endless rate

	Speculate, Speculate 
	Consequences aggregate

	Speculate, Speculate 
	Can you really keep the Faith?

	The rich get richer, 
	the poor get poorer,
	Inequality!

	Debts through the roof
	Prices on the rise
	Inequality!

	The interest you get,
	The interest you pay,
	Inequality!

	Handouts for the rich
	Austerity for the poor
	Inequality!

The balance sheet grows, new all-times highs
Debt doesn’t matter, that’s how money dies

Driving up prices, raging inflation
Resources soar, consumer frustration

Technocratic babble, the Fed is inane
The unelected power, we see that money reigns

Playing with fire, ignoring the signs
We’ve lost the skills, to read between the lines

	Waiting for the bounce, or ready to melt down?
	Beaten to the ground, shut it all down!

	Speculate, Speculate
		Barbarians are at the Gate
	Speculate, Speculate
		Down and down at a rapid rate
	Speculate, Speculate 
		Consequences aggregate		
	Speculate, Speculate 
		How long until we seal our Fate?

	The rich get richer,
	the poor get poorer,
	Inequality!

	Debts through the roof
	Prices on the rise
	Inequality!

	Politicians bought,
	with money for power
	Inequality!

	Handouts for the rich
	Austerity for the poor
	Inequality!
