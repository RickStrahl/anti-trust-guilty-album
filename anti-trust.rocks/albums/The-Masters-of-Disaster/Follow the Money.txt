Follow the money, it’s leading way
Into the shadows of corruption and decay
Follow the money, it never lies 
Unravel the truth, beneath the disguise
Mal-invested faith that’s gone insane
Wasted wealth that’s spent in vain

  Follow the money, follow the trail
  Follow the greed, follow the fail
  Follow the power, follow the crime
  Follow corruption, follow the slime

  Follow the money
  Corruption and abuse
  Follow the Money
  That's where you'll find the truth

In the halls of power we see corruption breed
Politicians selling out for their selfish needs
Easy money flows like a river untamed
But below the surface the system is maimed
Massive corporate lobbies are weapons of choice
Media and corporations are squashing your voice

  Follow the money, follow the trail
  Follow the greed, follow the fail
  Follow the power, follow the crime
  Follow corruption, follow the slime

  Follow the money
  Corruption and abuse
  Follow the Money
  That's where you'll find the truth

Tech, pharma, media and government prime
All bought and paid for on a fabricated dime
Financial ignorance is spoon fed to the masses
Long time money printing has impoverished lower classes
Inflating currencies are the weapons of choice
Fabricated poverty is squashing your voice

  Follow the money, follow the trail
  Follow the greed, follow the fail
  Follow the power, follow the crime
  Follow corruption, follow the slime

  Follow the Money
  Follow the Money
