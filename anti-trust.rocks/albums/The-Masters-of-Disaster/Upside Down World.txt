Bankers will ensure that you always stay in debt
Enforced insurance you pay and can’t collect
Global conglomerates that keep our food constricted
Pharmaceutical cartels ensure you’re addicted
Schools are churning out mindless empty vassals
Good wards of the state to pay all the taxes
Weapons manufactures send us off to war
A media that ensures we never know... the score!

    The sky is below and the ground is above
    The judges are criminals, the wolf's a dove
    When the news is a joke and comedy’s a fact
    We’ve lost our way and sold our social contract

Churches hide behind an evil disguise
Faith and trust perverted, all but theirs despised
Finance has been turned into a devious attraction
Regulatory oversight is missing in action
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer
No consequences and a lack of furor
Eat the rich, that’s we love to say
But Money talks and bullshit walks away

    The sky is below and the ground is above
    The judges are criminals, the wolf's a dove
    When the news is a joke and comedy’s a fact
    We’ve lost our way and sold our social contract
