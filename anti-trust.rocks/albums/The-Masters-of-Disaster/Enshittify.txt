In the land of silicone dreams
Where gadgets reign supreme
Shiny toys bought for a thrill
Never enough to get your fill
Obsolete the day that you buy
Time to live it’s fixed to die
Forced on to the subscription ride
Prices are rising, I'm stuck in the tide
I wanna get out, they won't let me go
Trapped in this cycle of digital war!


    Enshittify! Enshittify!
    Your upgrades have been denied

    Enshittify! Enshittify!
    Rip it up, and watch it die

    Enshittify! Enshittify!
    Digitally crucified

    Enshittify! Enshittify! 
    Don’t you bother asking why  

Broken toys, that you can’t fix
They’re left to die in a pile of bricks
Media that’s been weaponized
Psychological warfare, barely disguised
Ads that pay your time online 
Monetized scams it's a digital crime 
You’re the product all your data is mined
Every step is traced and signed
Tracked and tagged, to read your mind
Twisting your thoughts to keep you confined
