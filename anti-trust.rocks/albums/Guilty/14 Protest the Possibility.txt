The Possibility of Lifeâ€™s Destruction

Can you hear the sound of an enormous door
slamming in the depths of hell

   The possibility of life's destruction

Can you hear the cries of pain the mournful sound

   The possibility of life's destruction

Can you hear the sound of an enormous door 
slamming in the depths of hell

   The possibility of life's destruction

Can you hear the cries of pain the mournful sound

   The possibility of life's destruction
