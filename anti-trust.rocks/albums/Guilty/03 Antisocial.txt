Just stay away from me
Just leave me alone
I'm gonna figure it out
All on my own
Don't wanna talk to you,
I don't want to see
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know…

    I'm antisocial today…
    I'm antisocial today…   (2x)

I've heard it all
I don't care what you want
I'm telling you, I've had enough of this today
I walking away
And I'm never looking back
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care

    I'm antisocial today…
    I'm antisocial today…   (2x)

I walk alone
No time for anyone
Don't need nobody to make me feel alright
No boring lines
and no bullshit games
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind

    I'm antisocial today…
    I'm antisocial today…   (2x)
