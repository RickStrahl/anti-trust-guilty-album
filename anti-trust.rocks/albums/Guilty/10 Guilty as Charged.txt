The pressure is weighing me down
From people all around of this town
Conform to the lie, or give up and die
No room for individuals to see eye to eye

    They are going to make us pay
    Our debt to society
    Locked up, shut down, thrown to the floor
    Guilty as charged, I'm guilty as charged

Can't live my life by the rules anymore
Gotta get out and find my own core

    They are going to make us pay
    Our debt to society
    No trial, no justice, hung out to dry
    I'm guilty as charged, I'm guilty as charged

I'm guilty, guilty, guilty as charged…
Guilty, guilty, guilty as charged…
Society's guilty, guilty as charged…
Society's guilty, guilty as charged!
