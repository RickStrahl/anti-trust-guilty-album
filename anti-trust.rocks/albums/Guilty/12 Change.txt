Financial catastrophe, political bankruptcy
Ready to destroy the democracy

Social idiocy - complete fucking apathy
To the backdrop of – total hypocrisy…

Greed that leads to misery, that robs all the treasury
Surveillance from above, the loss of privacy

Heinous acts of treachery, without a charge of perjury
The eye in the sky, to kill all privacy

	Change!
	It’s all gonna change,
	nothing stays the same, 
	it’s an all new Game

	Change!
	it’s all gonna change, 
	the Status Quo is done, 
	and nothing stays the same

Debt fueled insanity, malinvested robbery
Ready to produce inequality 

Trickle up economy - legalized burglary!
Nothing more than... financial chicanery

Red pill, blue pill make a choice, 
pretend that you still have a voice
Shut up and go back, to your phone-y toys

	Change!
	It’s all gonna change, 
	nothing stays the same, 
	it’s an all new Game
	
	Change!
	it’s all gonna change, 
	the Status Quo is done, 
	and nothing stays the same
	
	We all have to… change, we all have to… 
	Change… Change!

Police brutality, legalized lethality
Ready to destroy our society

Fascist pigs and Commie grunts,
Nothing more than media stunts
The fight is televised... on the media front
	
	Change!
	It’s all gonna change, 
	nothing stays the same, 
	it’s an all new Game

	Change!
	It’s all gonna change, 
	the Status Quo is done, 
	and nothing stays the same
 
We have to change, or we will be changed

We have to change, or… we… will… be…… Changed!
