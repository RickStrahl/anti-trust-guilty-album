Circular logic from circular sources
The talking head that only reinforces
Technocratic pseudo science 
The righteous source of forced compliance
Repeat the rhyme, again and again

  Shut up and obey
  There’s nothing you can say
  Fear Factory, Fear Factory
  The Fear Factory way

  Shut up and obey
  Day after day 
  Fear Factory, Fear Factory
  The Fear Factory way

Oh dear, oh my, the sky is falling
When does the next crisis come a-calling
Russian spies and commie bots
Syrian gas and brutal cops 
Repeat the rhyme again and again   

  Shut up and obey
  There’s nothing you can say
  Fear Factory, Fear Factory
  The Fear Factory way

  Don’t do what we do,
  Just do what we say,
  Fear Factory, Fear Factory
  The Fear Factory way
 
Are you entertained, are you having your fun?
Living your life under the feudal thumb
Do as I say, don’t do as I do
The hypocrites are just laughing at you!

  Shut up and obey
  Just do what we say,
  Fear Factory, Fear Factory
  The Fear Factory way

  Shut up and obey
  Day after day 
  Fear Factory, Fear Factory
  The Fear Factory way
