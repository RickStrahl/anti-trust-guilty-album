I'm everything that you hate and despise
I'm everything that you loathe and disguise
I'm everything that you wish you could be
I'm the motherfucker you can't stand to see

    I am you and you are me,
    I am you and you are me,

    Search and Destroy,
    Kill everything you know
    Apocalypse now, Apocalypse now    (2x)

Look in the mirror and what do you see?
A world of hatred looking back at you and me!
Punch and smash the glass with your fist of pain
You know you're everything that's gone insane

    I am you and you are me,
    I am you and you are me,

    Search and Destroy,
    Kill everything you know
    Apocalypse now, Apocalypse now   (2x)

Apocalypse now, Apocalypse now   (8x)
