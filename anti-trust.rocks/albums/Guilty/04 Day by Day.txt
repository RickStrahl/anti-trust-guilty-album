Day by Day and night after night
I walk around not feeling right
Can hear the voices talking so loud,
What the Hell, there’s no one around
Cannot sleep, cannot write
Cannot work and cannot hide
Cannot stand this misery,
I don’t know what’s wrong with me

    Day by Day, just take it slow today
    Day by Day, just let it go away
    Day by Day, and Night after Night
    Day by Day, just get it right
    Day by Day, Night After Night
    Day by Day, just get it right

Every Day and every Night
I struggle through my inner fight
Chasing yet another thrill
It’s nothing more than time to kill
I don’t know where I’m going
but I sure know where I’ve been
Walking on the edge of a knife
Can’t make sense of this fucking life

    Day by Day, just take it slow today
    Day by Day, just let it go away
    Day by Day, and Night after Night
    Day by Day, just get it right
    Day by Day, Night After Night
    Day by Day, just get it right

Every Day and every Night
I try to find my guiding light
I’m working hard stay in the ‘Now’
But I cannot seem to figure out how
Inner self, inner mind
Should trust myself to what I find
Gotta loose this misery,
I’ve gotta find, what’s right for me

    Day by Day, just take it slow today
    Day by Day, just let it go away
    Day by Day, and Night after Night
    Day by Day, just get it right
    Day by Day, Night After Night
    Day by Day, just get it right

    Day by Day, Day by Day...
