There's a man who takes your wallet
There's a man who takes your beer
There's a man who takes your woman
There's a man who just takes you

    He's a government official
    That's what his papers say
    He's a government official
    And he takes you every day

There's a man who takes your cigarettes
There's a man who takes your car
There's a man who takes the piss out of you
But he's the biggest thief by far

    He's a government official
    Knocking on your door
    He's a government official
    Coming back for more

    He's organised
    Organised crime
    Organised crime

    He's organised
    Organised crime
    Organised crime

There's a man who takes your petrol
There's a man who takes your phone
There's a man who takes your place in the queue
There's a man who just takes you

    He's a government official
    Checking up on you
    He's a government official
    There's nothing you can do

    He's organised
    Organised crime
    Organised crime

    He's organised
    Organised crime
    Organised crime

    He's organised
    Organised crime
    Organised crime

    He's organised
    Organised crime
    Organised crime
