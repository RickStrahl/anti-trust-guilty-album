Information overload at your fingertips
Write in your name just to be in the game
Now they’ve got your number, the goods to pin you down
Hello Mr. Doe can we sell you your life?

    There’s a fly on the wall
    Listening to every word I say
    There’s an eye in the sky
    No… Privacy, No… Privacy

Everywhere you go the go, the walls are full of eyes
Smile for the cameras, ‘cause it’s your lucky day
50 Seconds for fame, your spot on TV
Big Brother, he’s watching and he’s taunting me…

    There’s a fly on the wall
    Listening to every word I say
    There’s an eye in the sky
    No… Privacy, No… Privacy

All the information it’s right up there online,
Opening up a world hurt for computer crime
Research your life, and spy on neighbor Sam,
Who’s got his eye on you with his digi-cam…

    No… Privacy,  No… Privacy
    No… Privacy,  No… Privacy
    No… Privacy,  No… Privacy
    No… no, no, no … NO!
